## Paper Rock Scissors game

This project is a paper rock scissors game made in ReactJS, I've designed the interface using a minimalist style with some animations and conditional styling. The application is organized in a main component that loads the game phases (as you can see in the project files) depending in which phase the game is, the majority of states are set in this main component that also pass the states through props.
